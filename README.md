Health Insurance costs analysis
1. Research scenario
The research scenario focusses on how patient demographics and health characteristics influence the amount of insurance claims the patients are likely to receive. The dataset includes data on patient age, gender, BMI, blood pressure levels, diabetic status, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to understand how these factors interact and contribute to the likelihood and magnitude of insurance claims.

2. Specific questions/Objectives of analysis
1.	To identify and measure the strength of the relationships between continuous variables (e.g., BMI, age) and the insurance claim amounts
2.	To assess how well different attributes predict insurance claim amounts individually and together, and to explore their interactions with other variables.
3.	To examine if there are significant differences in insurance claim amounts across different regions
4.	To evaluate the impact of significant  independent variable on insurance claims while controlling for regional differences.

3. Dataset Description
The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle, which includes demographic and health-related information linked to insurance claims. This dataset is designed to provide deep insights into how various factors influence the amounts of insurance claims. This information gives us valuable insights that can be used to make  informed decisions for insurance providers when considering potential customers for their services
